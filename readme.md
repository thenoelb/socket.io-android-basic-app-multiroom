## Android Basic MultiRoom App ##

Basically an app to see if I could send a socket event to a custom room in a socket server I created.

UI is literally just to get that working, so please don't judge my UI design on that. :)

(Based off of my other (VERY BASIC) app [socket.io-android-basic-app](https://github.com/thenoelb/socket.io-android-basic-app]))
